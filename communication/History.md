## History Responsible

### Description

As history responsible you document and bring the chapter’s history to life so that future activities can make use of it and all members can take part in it.

You are also responsible for keeping contact with the chapter’s alumni. This means informing them about events that may interest them and creating opportunities for members to connect with alumni.

You make sure that all committees maintain their part of the PM of traditions, and you take responsibility for preserving the chapter’s overall traditions.

- **Access Privileges:** What areas the position has access to that the normal student doesn't.
- **Time Requirement:** Difficult to define, you gather history as things happen.

### Experiences gained

Chapter history and contacts with old chapter members.

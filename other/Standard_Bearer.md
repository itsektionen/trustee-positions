## Standard Bearer

### Description

As standard bearer your job is to act as a representative of both KTH and the IT-chapter at larger ceremonial events held by the school. At these events, such as the graduation ceremony, your responsibility is to hold the standard and march with, wave and showcase the standard in accordance with the instructions from THS Fanborgen.

In addition to the practical task of holding the standard, we must also act as role models to the chapter and the rest of the school. We have been chosen by the chapter to represent it at some of the highest level events at KTH, where we sometimes even meet royalty. As such, we must uphold that level of professionalism, respect, and honour both at the events themselves and to everyone at the school at all times.

- **Access Privileges:** What areas the position has access to that the normal student doesn't.
- **Time Requirement:** Total around 100h over the year. 8h per event day, of which there are around 9 events over the course of the year. You must also put in preparation time which primarily consists of ensuring your clothing matches the given specifications as well as keeping a check on the standard's well being.

### Experiences gained

As a standard bearer, you get to attend some of the higher profile events at KTH. These make for rare experiences that very few people ever get to try. Firstly, you obtain practical knowledge such as an understanding of formal attire, knowledge of standard bearing movements, and even how to maintain a standard. However, the more significant experience you gain consists of cultivating a deeper connection with other chapters/THS, obtaining a greater respect for the educational institution as a whole, and finding a new perspective with which to view the entire KTH experience that I don't think you can find anywhere else.

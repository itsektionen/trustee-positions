## Safety Officer

### Description

You manage situations that involve student safety. Usually these are "incidents" between students that happen within the bounds of KTH. Not all incidents are under your jurisdiction, but mainly you point the people to the right methods of help. (mainly study councillor, public resources for mental health, but extremely rarely, go higher up and contact police).

You are also technically responsible for the safety of Kistan in terms of medkits and other equipment.

Informally, you are the person to talk to if stuff goes wrong in between students.

- **Access Privileges:** What areas the position has access to that the normal student doesn't.
- **Time Requirement:** A few hours a year

### Experiences gained

Conflict mediation, conflict assessment, technically counselling (you are not meant to but sometimes it happens anyway).
